Clone the project from the repository  

```	
	$git clone https://github.com/Geocent/iqms
```


Change directory to project  

```	
$ cd iqms
```


Install node dependencies via npm  

```	
$ npm install
```

Set up psql in separate terminal  

```
	$ psql
	$ ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD '1233456';
	$ CREATE DATABASE iqms_development;  
```

To start: back in /iqms  

```
	$ chmod +x bin/www_test
	$ cd bin
	$ ./www_test
```	

To open app: from a browser, go to  

```
	http://localhost:3000/static/www/
```	

###Notes:

bin/www is daemonized, bin/www_test is not  
tests can be ran with `$ mocha`


###Command Line for PostgreSQL

```
$ psql (starts PostgreSQL so that other commands can be run)
DROP DATABASE <name> (deletes the database)
CREATE DATABASE <name> (creates the database)
/l (lists databases)
/c <name> (connects to database <name>)
/dt (lists all tables in connected database)
/d <table> (displays columns of <table> in connected database)
```
Whenever any of the model files are modified, the database must be dropped and re-created, and the server must be restarted. Otherwise, the changes will not take place and errors can occur.


###Config:

The config.json should be placed in the config folder of the root of the project
