  QUESTION 4 (Intermediate):
    What is the difference between event bubbling and event capture?
    ANSWER:
      Event bubbling and capturing are two ways of event propagation in the HTML DOM API, when an event occurs in an 
      element inside another element, and both elements have registered a handle for that event. 
      The event propagation mode determines in which order the elements receive the event.
      With bubbling, the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element and then propagated to outer elements.
      With capturing, the event is first captured by the outermost element and propagated to the inner elements.
